# All my things for playing around with the Raspberry Pi

### node.sh
* A simple script to install nodejs approriately on raspian using nvm (node version manager).

### echobase
* A nodejs webserver to facilitate some home automationisims.

### thegrid
* another nodejs webserver to facilitate some home automationisms. Tron theme, chessboard password which is pretty neat, though not entirely practical. Thinking about it, its kind of like Ron having to play an amazing game of Wizards Chess at the end of 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'.
